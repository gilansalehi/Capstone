Clickapedia is Wikipedia, upgraded.  View articles on your favorite topics,
now with stunning full-color header images.  If you're interested in an article
that is not in our database, fetch it straight from Wikipedia with the easy
to use WikiFetcher.  Edit any article with the click of a button.  If at first
you think nothing has changed, think again: the entire page is now an editable
document, a pixel-perfect preview of your final product.  

What you see is what you get.  It's never been easier.

Has Wikipedia's lackluster search functionality got you down?  Clickapedia has a
lightning-fast search feature that searches over the full text of the article,
so you'll never waste time searching for that awesome paragraph you read that
one time on a late-night wikiwalk.

Stay up-to-date on the most recent articles and goings-on from the Clickapedia
home page, with a running list of all the latest and greatest, updated in
real time right on the home page.  Just hide the sidebar and this site will
look great on mobile devices too.
