# Wikiwand Magic

* Apply a totally different set of CSS styles to every page, making it
beautiful.

# Homepage Newsfeed

* Display a "What's New" column, of the most recently created articles.
  * SQL query to the database LIMIT 10 order by Date Created DESC.
  * create a article fragment view in react as a link to those pages.

# Editor Rating

Wikipedia's greatest strength is also its weakness: anyone can edit a page.
I'd like to implement a feature that will hopefully prevent vandals from
editing pages.  In order to edit a page, your account must have a certain
minimum editor rating with the community to qualify as a trusted source.
I will assign each user a score based on: how much content they generate, how
frequently or infrequently their content is edited by other users, how
recently they became an editor, and other significant markers of a user's
trustworthiness.
